# Evolution
This idea of Evolution occurred to me that every human is like a network when he/she was born. Here is why:
1. Human baby is initialized by some weights (carved in DNA), so the baby will sleep/eat/cry/smile/pee, etc.
2. As the baby is growing, it's like the network is training. Multiple modality datasets are used to train this network. So the baby begins to show some functions, like talking, walking, etc.
3. Different environments will result in different training outcomes. So no one is the same as anyone in the world. But we all can walk, talk, learn, etc. This is because we are trained by the similar datasets. 
4. The list can go on. 

What'more, the network is more like MMoE. Just to think about how a MMoE is trained and how we are growing. We are receiving so many kinds of datasets: voice, image, text (now mostly used), smell, pain, touch, etc. Our response to multi-modality input is very fast, this means there is some kind of mechanism to control network inference (otherwise we would be dummy).

Our neural cells are our computing resources (compute, communicate and store). It's said that we haven't explored all our brain yet, even the smartest guy hasn't achieved this. So it means, as long as we are trained with new datasets, we can gain more skills (this is exactly as the fact).

We can learn things that are totally different. The process of learning one thing usually helps (sometimes may interfere) us to learn another. Doesn't it sound like the training of MMoE?

Now, MMoE is the only network structure that's proved to be effectively scaling up a model with billions of trillions of parameters. As far as I can see, the brain evolution of a baby is like the training of MMoE. 

# Electronic baby
Thus I would like to start a project of raising an eletronic baby, combining all the support available on the internet. This eletronic baby doesn't have a name yet. Anyone participated in this project would become a parent of this baby, and is encouraged to give suggestions and vote for its name later. So what kind of support are needed?
A baby can turn out to be any one with proper guidance. It roughly takes 4 stages of raising a baby:
1. Create a basic baby, with initialzed weights. (MMoE basic network)
2. Teach new skills. (Train the model with new datasets, adding new experts)
3. Teach he/she the skill to learn by self. (Tough one, need more advice)
4. Contribute to the society. (You may have many ideas about this one, all parents would discuss it together. But the baby should never break any law and harm anyone in any countries)

# Baby functions
This list can go on as more people participate and support this project. (Encouraging multiple launguage skills)
1. Talk. 
2. Write.
3. See.
4. Sing.
5. math.
6. etc. 

# How to participate?
The structure of baby network is MMoE. We can add experts to the backbone network. Also, it is necessary to upload trained models for related experts and skills. 
Will update more details about this part soon.
